# Paisley Grammar and Language Support

This extension provides language support for the [Paisley](https://github.com/ZacharyWesterman/paisley) scripting language.
The current supported version is at least v1.16.7, and will work fine for more recent versions (if there's no new syntax).

Features include:
- Syntax highlighting.
- Syntax validation.
- Type checking.
- Hover info for some code entities.
- Warnings for poorly formed code.
- Marking dead code blocks.
